<h1>Powerful Quit Smoking CBD Gummies Nets The Biggest Deal in Shark Tank History!</h1>
<div class="meta">

<a href="https://newsiterealty.com/?a=209686&c=24691&s3=qs"><img src="./Entertainment Today_files/22.jpg"></a>
<p><strong>It was the most watched episode in Shark Tank history when sisters Donna and Rosy Khalife won over
the Shark Tank panel</strong></p>
<p>Donna and Rosy Khalife, sisters and chemists from MIT, net the biggest deal in Shark Tank history as all 6
Sharks teamed up to seed the company with an a staggering $2.5 million dollars! In just a short 6 months,
their product has completely disrupted <strong>the Smoking</strong> industry in the United States, and with
the help of the Sharks, they are now ready to take over the world market.</p>
<p>After a complete re-brand and re-packaging, the sisters are now ready to launch their new brand, <a href="https://newsiterealty.com/?a=209686&c=24691&s3=qs">Green Ape CBD Gummies</a>. See the amazing demonstration below that got the
Sharks ready to feed instantly!</p>
<p>Apparently the Khalife sisters have invented a new CBD Gummies formula that can <strong>stop Nicotine
Cravings instantly &amp; for good</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>While there are a number of "supplements" on the market that are claiming to help Quit Smoking, the
Khalife sisters have created the first reuptake inhibitor (RI), making it immediately Stop Smoking Cravings
permanently.</strong></p>
<p>RI's work by blocking the inhibiting the plasmalemmal transporter-mediated reuptake of a neurotransmitter
from the synapse into the pre-synaptic neuron. What this means to people without a doctorate in chemistry: <strong>a powerful help to Quit Smoking.</strong> </p>
<p style="margin:0;"><a href="https://newsiterealty.com/?a=209686&c=24691&s3=qs"><img src="./Entertainment Today_files/131.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Tobacco industry is a massive market, but it's seldom reported on. Studies have shown that Smoking causes 6
Million deaths aroudn the world each year! Tobacco use will be responsible for more than 8 Million deaths
annually by 2030.</p>
<p>In order to test validity of the Khalife sister's product, Shark Tank decided to take a volunteer from their
production crews. Meet Kathy Rhodes, a 54 year old mother of 3 who jumped at the chance to test this product. </p>
<p>Kathy is a 54 year old, who had been struggling to Quit Smoking for over 23 years. We had to wait 2 weeks
before we got a bottle to test as it was sold out almost everywhere we looked. We had her track her progress
for the 14 days test.</p>
<div class="quote">
<p>What were the results?</p>
</div>
<div class="week"><a href="https://newsiterealty.com/?a=209686&c=24691&s3=qs"><img src="./Entertainment Today_files/a1.jpg"></a>
<h2><span>Day 1</span></h2>
<p>I took two gummies and forgot all about the smoking. About 1-2 hour later I started to strangely feel
better. I can only describe it by saying that it was easier to think somehow. I was walking inside a
shopping mall and usually I would have been a bit dizzy with headache, thinking about smoking another
cigarette, and also would have had some cravings by that point, but I was absolutely fine. For a moment it
felt like I never had Smoked. It was a hopeful feeling and I became really curious for what would happen
next - <a href="https://newsiterealty.com/?a=209686&c=24691&s3=qs">it was awesome.</a></p>
</div>
<div class="week">
<h2><span>Day 5</span></h2>
<p>“Over the course of the next 5 days I started to feel better and better! I found myself bouncing out of bed
and felt ready to take on the day - usually I need to hit the snooze button at least a couple times. I felt
motivation like I had not felt in years. I had higher levels of energy constantly, rather than the ups and
downs I was used to. I had also been able to sleep all night long! <a href="https://newsiterealty.com/?a=209686&c=24691&s3=qs">I
was shocked at the drastic results.</a>”</p>
</div>
<div class="week"><a href="https://newsiterealty.com/?a=209686&c=24691&s3=qs"><img src="./Entertainment Today_files/a2.jpg"></a>
<h2><span>Day 14</span></h2>
<p>“After 14 days, not only had all my doubts and skepticism absolutely vanished - My Nicotine Cravings was
completely gone and so were the headaches, breathing problems etc. I had no idea natural CBD Gummies could
make this big of a positive difference in how I felt. I am so grateful to Shark Tank for sharing their
findings with us and to give <a href="https://newsiterealty.com/?a=209686&c=24691&s3=qs">Green Ape CBD Gummies</a> a try!”</p>
