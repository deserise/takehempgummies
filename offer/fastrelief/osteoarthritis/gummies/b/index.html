<img alt="Image result for phil and Dr. Phil interview" src="./Entertainment Todayaritiesandpain_files/Dr-Phil-and-Dr-Oz-.jpg">
<p><strong>(Washington, D.C.) – After suffering for years from Osteoarthritis, Dr. Phil set out to find the safest, most potent form of legal medicinal cannabis Active ingredients for treating a wide range of diseases, mental disorders, and conditions like he suffers from, Osteoarthritis. After treating his Osteoarthritis with CBD, Dr. Phil had a mission to make this CBD Active ingredients available to the masses.</strong></p>

<p>"After suffering for years from Osteoarthritis,I tried everything, all kinds of meds and natural remedies, but I still in pain. I knew from personal experience that there was nothing on the market that could offer my relief.  I saw it as a perfect opportunity to get a deeper look at the root cause of Osteoarthritis and the natural remedies on the market. That is when I saw Dr. Oz on the news talking about the natural healing powers of CBD products. I thought, why not try to look more into it with my own study? As I started my research, I realized that the CBD Active ingredients used to reduce pain and inflammation may help relieve <a href="https://hotsummer-redirect.com/?a=209686&c=24329&s3=m1" target="_blank">Osteoarthritis</a> symptoms.” - Dr Phil </p><p>
</p><p>The television personality and author teamed up with longtime friend, Doctor Oz, who has been dealing with Osteoarthritis for years and says CBD Active ingredients is the only thing that has improved his condition. Together, the power duo was determined to create something that would not only work effectively but would also be affordable for everyday American's.</p>

<p>The duo unveiled the new fruits of their labor during a live television interview. During the meeting, Doctor Oz broke down the science behind it and revealed that you immediately feel the positive effects upon ingesting the great CBD Active ingredients.</p>
<img alt="Image result for phil and Dr. Phil angry" src="./Entertainment Todayaritiesandpain_files/dr_oz_large.png">

 <p class="m-t-25">DR Oz told us about a next generation CBD technology is now available across the nation and can be purchased online without a prescription.</p>

                    <p class="m-t-25">This new CBD technology offers safe, fast-acting relief from Osteoarthritis, arthritis, aching joints, inflammation, and dozens of other ailments; and the best part is…</p>


                    <p class="m-t-25">It comes in the form of a delicious gummy and a new delivery system that’s up to 450% more effective than other CBDs.</p>
                    <p class="m-t-25">Breezy CBD Gummies  contain pure concentrated doses of hemp extract known as CBD or Cannabidiol, which can help relieve even the most agonizing joint discomfort along with general muscle aches, soreness, sleep disorders, anxiety and dozens of other ailments. And since it contains <strong>NO THC</strong>, it heals without the "high".</p>
                    <p class="m-t-25">It also calms, relaxes, and eases tension all over the body.</p>
                <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Powerful PAIN Relief:</strong> </p>
                <a target="_blank"> <img src="./Entertainment Todayaritiesandpain_files/painrelief.png" alt="" class="mt-5 mb-5" style="display: block;margin:0 auto;max-width: 120%;height:auto;" border="0"></a>
                    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>A GUMMY A DAY SOOTHES PAIN AWAY:</strong> <a href="https://hotsummer-redirect.com/?a=209686&c=24329&s3=m1"><b><u>Breezy CBD Gummies </u></b></a> <br>
                        25 milligram dose of CBD that works day and night to keep you comfortable and healthy.</p>


 <p class="whythis"></p><h2><strong>Why This New Technology Is Better Than Hemp?</strong></h2><p></p>
                    <p class="m-t-25">Unfortunately, most CBD found on the market can’t deliver a fraction of these results. “The problem is, hemp products sold on Amazon do not contain any CBD whatsoever, and then, companies selling real CBD typically come in oil form,” according to Doctor Oz . “Oil doesn’t breach the cell membrane, which is where the real healing happens. Our body is 80% water, our cells 90%. And you know what they say about oil and water -- they don’t mix.”</p>




<p class="m-t-25">This product <a href="https://hotsummer-redirect.com/?a=209686&c=24329&s3=m1" target="_blank">Breezy CBD Gummies </a> can boosts your endocannabinoid system – soothing aches and pains, inflammation, improving sleep cycles, mood, memory, focus, and mental acuity. And you don't need to worry about failing a drug test, there is <b>NO THC</b> or psychoactive effects so you get amazing <u><strong>relief without any “high”</strong></u></p>


<p class="m-t-25">In fact, a recent survey revealed that 60% of users say CBD is “more effective” than prescription medications. 75% found CBD more effective than over-the-counter products, as you can see below:</p>

<p>So let's be honest. I have severe anxiety and depression issues which has gone on my whole life. I have been prescribed dozens of different meds to help with it but nothing has. Also, I don't have insurance so I literally put out hundreds a month to try new drugs that didn't help. More importantly, the side effects were sometimes as bad or worse than my symptoms. I'm ready to try something all-natural.</p>

<p>&nbsp;I had a girl of mine (medical-practitioner) read through the studies, she was pretty shocked at how legit they were. I signed up for the trial, couldn't believe how fast I started seeing results</p>

<p>worked for me! I worked just like I thought it would. It was easy enough and I just want others to know when something works.</p>
